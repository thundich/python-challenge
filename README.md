  Python Module Challenge 3: Creating Python scripts for PyBank and PyPoll from the datasets provided to generate data analysis reports 

## Requirements
  - PyBank:
    - Using the dataset, budget_data.csv, that is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses and creating a Python script that analyzes the records that calculates each of the following: 
        - The total number of months included in the dataset
        - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
        - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
        - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

    - Note: The screen formatting is intentional as I was experimenting with display configuration. 
      - Greatest Increase in Profits is intended to show with dollar sign, comma, and decimal point. 
      - Greatest Decrease in Profits is intended to show dollar and negative sign. 
      - The output file is not using formatting. 

  - PyPoll: Using the dataset, election_data.csv, that is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate and creating a Python script that analyzes the records that calculates each of the following:
        - The total number of votes cast
        - A complete list of candidates who received votes
        - The percentage of votes each candidate won
        - The total number of votes each candidate won
        - The winner of the election based on popular vote.


## Installation and Configuration 
	- Python 
	
	- Files included with repository include the CSV file code, README, Python Program main.py, and Text Output File from Python Script. 

  - One of the limitations that is found in the repository is the large dataset in the CSV file codes.
